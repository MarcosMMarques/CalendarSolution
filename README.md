## :date: How it works
<p>The Program asks the user for month and year values in the main <b>program.cs class</b>, passes these values to the objects of the class called <b>calendar.cs</b> which has 3 functions, 2 of which are to <b>validate the month and year that the user has typed</b>, the third function is the one that <b>generates the calendar</b> in which it searches for the first day that begins that month that the user typed and the number of days in that month, and with these data it skips the empty days and builds an array with the existing days of that month.</p>
